# Smart-medibox

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **Medibox Simulation** project, an individual exercise for the **EN2853 Embedded Systems and Applications** course. This project simulates a fully functional Medibox using the **ESP32 microcontroller** on the **Wokwi platform**.

## Key Features
- **Time Zone & NTP Synchronization**: Set the time zone and fetch the current time from the NTP server.
- **Alarm Management**: Set and manage up to 3 alarms with proper visual and audio indications.
- **Alarm Control**: Stop alarms using a push button, and disable all alarms if needed.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Monitor temperature and humidity levels, with warnings for unhealthy conditions.

This repository contains the code and resources for the project, organized in a clear and structured manner for ease of use.

## Project Significance
 The evaluation focuses on:
- Fetching the current time via NTP.
- Efficient menu navigation for alarm management.
- Proper indications when alarms are active or disabled.
- Real-time monitoring of environmental conditions (temperature and humidity).
